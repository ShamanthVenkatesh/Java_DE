Clone repository to local machine
git clone https://github.com/ShamanthVenkatesh/Java_DE.git

Please include `winutils.exe` to "hadoop.home.dir" before running spark-jobs on local instance.
For spark-jobs we would need to set "hadoop.home.dir" as `System.setProperty("hadoop.home.dir", "C:\\hadoop\\hadoop-3.3.1\\");`

Please save the `winutils.exe` in a bin directory and provide the path one-level above to bin.

C:
|	hadoop
	|	hadoop-3.3.1
		|	bin
			|	winutils.exe
